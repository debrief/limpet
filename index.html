        <p>Welcome to the Lightweight InforMation ProcEssing Toolkit - Limpet.</p>
        <h4>July 2017</h4>
        <p>There has been a large block of development during the summer, which included the addition
	of support for 2-dimensional datasets.  Read more about the new capabilities
        <a href="http://debrief.info/two-dimensional-datasets/">here</a>

	</p>
        <h4>April 2017</h4>
        <p>An emergent requirement meant that Limpet needs to be able to index data by quantities other than time.  
	Support for time-series has been sufficient for all tasks we asked of Limpet so far, but now we need to
	support data indexed by distance (as with a weather balloon ascent).  Read more about supporting
	non time-series data <a href="http://debrief.info/datasets-indexed-by-non-time-data/">here</a>. 
	For this new support we've adopted the 
	<a href="https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/science.january">Eclipse January</a> project.

        <h4>August 2015</h4>
        <p>Things are pretty embryonic right now - we're still 
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ipW-9e6OtPGuiz4x9FiDj5KdcMab6lOqqck8jPH8rWU/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000">going through</a> high level requirements collection,.  But,
        we hope to motor on through the high level questions, discussions, plans, designs, and get into some nice 
        iterative/agile progress in early September.</p>
